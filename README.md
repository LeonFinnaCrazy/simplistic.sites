# simplistic.site
An repository containing some really useful, simple, and free sites to use.

### What exactly does this contain?
This repository contains free to use sites that get their purpose done. For example, if you go to `imgur.com`. You'll probably upload or find some pictures. But the site asks you to login, make your own, etc. Even if you don't want to do that.

This repository is something that dosen't contain sites like that.

# Hosting Services

It's usually hard to find good hosting services. You can't get a good free one nowadays. Here you may find some liable options.

## Image Hosting

[imgchest](https://imgchest.com/) - This is an clean and simple alternative to the imgur site. This not only contains hosting, but also features similar to imgur.

#### The following options above are some of the best options for image hosting. They're free, powerful, and simple. Most of them require `registration`.

#### Stay away from these options at all cost. Only use them if it's necessary or your forced.
- https://tinypic.com (Old Outdated interface, No multi image upload support, Compresses image, No hotlinking)

- https://imgur.com (Compresses images, biased and deletes images based on their own opinion)

- https://photobucket.com (Can't upload images as guest, Parent company of Tinypic, so even worse than tinypic)

# Multipurpose Hosting

These hosts will host **any** file for you. This includes all files types such as `archived files, images, etc`. They're all free to use.

- https://anonfiles.com/ - One of the best file hosting sites. 20gb filesize, unknown uploading system, unlimited bandwidth.
- https://catbox.moe/ - An simple alternative to others. Upload and recieve your url. Unlimited bandwidth, 200MB upload limit `/` **https://litterbox.catbox.moe/** (Temporary files alternative to catbox)

# Software Hosting
This one is the hardest to find, not only is it highly in demand for developers. It's also expensive and causes most newly hosting services shutdown within the first week. Some options below are some you may use.

- [PylexHosting](https://client.pylexnodes.net/) - An underrated hosting that provides `Minecraft Servers, NodeJS and Python` hosting. `10240MB Disk, 3072MB Ram, 150% CPU`

- [Free Hosting](https://www.freehosting.com/) - An somewhat popular hosting providing all the tools you need to make your own site. `Custom domain, cPanel, Site Builder`.

- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) - Best option If you're looking for messing around with VMs and etc.

These are the only options I were able to find that were good. Linode is an all-purpose hosting service which hosts `VMs` and `VPS`. Which you are free to install whatever you like.
